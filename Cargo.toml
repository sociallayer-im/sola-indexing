# aes-gcm-siv 0.10.3 and curve25519-dalek 3.x pin zeroize to <1.4
# which conflicts with other dependencies requiring zeroize ^1.5.
# We’re patching both crates to unpin zeroize.
#
# For aes-gcm-siv we’re using the same revision Solana uses in
# an (as of now) unreleased commit, see
# https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/commit/01f1bf27994d9813fadfcd134befd3a449aaa0bd
#
# For curve25519-dalek we’re using commit from a PR, see
# https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/606
